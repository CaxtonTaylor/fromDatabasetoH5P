00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.890
People are familiar with
the term physician.

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.650
They're often times referred to as doctors.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.637
Physicians collect health
history and perform

00:00:07.662 --> 00:00:10.274
thorough assessments in
order to make a diagnosis.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.270
If a patient is hospitalized,

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.150
the physician provides care to
the patient, during that time.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.180
The physician collaborates with
other health care providers,

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.430
such as other specialists and therapists,

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.900
to ensure the patient has
all of their needs met.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.937
They provide education to
the patient and family

00:00:25.962 --> 00:00:28.180
and help the patient to
navigate through the complex

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.200
healthcare setting to get
their medical needs met.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.248
Physicians are responsible
for overseeing

00:00:33.273 --> 00:00:36.074
and managing the patient's
entire health care needs.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.850
Physicians aren't the only choice
for a health care provider, though.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.160
Nurse practitioners are another option that
can provide primary care to a patient.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.160
