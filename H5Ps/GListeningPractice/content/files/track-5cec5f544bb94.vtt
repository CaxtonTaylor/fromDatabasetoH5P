In nineteen eleven,

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:06.350
famously brilliant inventor Thomas Edison was quoted as saying that by the year twenty eleven that 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.950
bars of gold had become is cheap and plentiful as bars of iron,

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.240
because we will have discovered the secret of transmitting medals by then.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:13.510
Well,

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.740
he was a little off because around that time it actually hit a record high value.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.910
See,

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.110
this is a good example of why people shouldn't speculate about things that they really don't know anything about.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.140
He was an inventor,

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.090
not an economist,

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.260
so he knew nothing about it.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.650
That would be like me predicting the price of haircuts in the next ten years.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.740
I clearly don't have any expertise in the area.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.740
