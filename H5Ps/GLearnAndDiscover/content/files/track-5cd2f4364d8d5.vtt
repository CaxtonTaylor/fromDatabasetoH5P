Life one hundred years ago versus life now.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.060
Things have changed a lot over the last one hundred years due to society and the way we 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:08.530
act.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:09.480
Think it feeling,

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:10.070
general.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.370
Some major differences between the way we live now and the lifestyle just a century ago include 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:16.970
the way we relate to one another.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.010
Theo education.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.030
We get the way we take care of ourselves and the way we use technology.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.150
Even love and money has a very different meaning today than it did back then.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.150
