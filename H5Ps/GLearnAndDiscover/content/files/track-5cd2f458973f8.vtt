00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:15.690
Yeah.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.080
My school's awesome.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.970
We're always doing cool stuff like this.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.550
Like,

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.790
did you know that dragon plays have been around for three hundred million years?

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.440
I just learned that caskets,

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.600
headlines like sponges,

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.990
which is waiting to soak up everything around us,

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.700
are naturally curious and love to dive in and figure out how things work.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.700
After all,

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.750
it's what you're best at,

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:45.980
you know,

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.650
true sign of intelligence is not knowledge of imagination.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.030
I didn't say that,

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.980
Albert.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.980
